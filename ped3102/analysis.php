When discussing the idea of whether or not our school system shortchanges girls, I believe that we need to focus not on giving a "yes" or "no" answer, but to consider the underlying social and educational implications and consequences of the issue.
What does it mean to "shortchange" somebody? What are the gender stereotypes and biases in the school system? What are the societal and media influences to the issue? What can educators do to decrease the educational barriers to girls?<br />
<br />
Focusing on the Ontario public education system, to shortchange someone would be to deny - consciously or unconsciously - any student the expected knowledge, skills, development, and advantages - explicit, null, and hidden - of the ministry curricula, and of the learning process as a whole. Simply put, shortchanging a student is a manifestation of inequity.
In this particular case, shortchanging a girl would be a manifestation of gender inequity where a female does not receive the same benefits from learning as her male counterpart.<br />
<br />
Sadly, gender inequity is a reality in the Ontario school system. Boys and girls are treated very differently in an educational setting, both by their peers and by their teachers.
Typically, this is invisible - neither students nor teachers are fully conscious of this educational inequity. It is well known that males and females do not mature at the same level, and often, girls mature much more quickly than boys. Yet, this is often a large contributor to gender inequity in schools: boys tend to be more active, assertive, outspoken, and rambunctious - they are easy targets to receive teacher attention.
However, girls tend to be quiet and attentive in a classroom setting, often going unnoticed by teachers. In an effort to maintain positive classroom management, it is easy to see how teachers focus more attention on boys than girls, but what does this message send to the girls? It is difficult to promote assertiveness and confidence - two attributes that educators strive to help their students develop - when 
those qualities are seen as masculine and troublesome.
Female students are much less likely than male students to display attention-seeking behavior - including volunteering to answer a question in a class setting, or sharing an academic opinion with their peers. This too, is an educational manifestation of gender inequity, because it hinders female students from displaying their achievements in ways that are easily measured by educators.<br />
<br />
It would be easy to make the issue of girls being shortchanged in school entirely about gender stereotypes that are overwhelmingly reinforced by mass media, because it is clear that students today are heavily influenced by the media and popular culture. Acknowledging that there are very clear and strong ties from the media and popular culture to gender inequity, this is an issue that extends beyond the media. School communities will always be influenced by popular culture - it is unavoidable.
With media and popular culture becoming increasingly accessible, students will always be able to look to the media for examples of females as submissive and second-class citizens.
The marketing branches of major corporations may not care about reinforcing gender stereotypes, because frankly, it has been financially successful, so there is no reason to change. We must remember that major corporations probably don’t care if girls are being shortchanged in schools. As educators, we must focus on factors that are within our 
control.<br />
<br />
It is important for educators to be aware of this issue in order to be cognizant of their actions in the classroom. Teachers, administrations, and school boards need to work together to create action plans to encourage girls to break the glass ceiling within the public education system. Perhaps most significantly, teachers must strive to model gender equity to their students by focusing equal amounts of positive and negative attention on boys and girls.
It may not always be easy, but it is extremely important; the simple act of giving boys and girls equal attention sends a positive and encouraging message. Educators must be open to creating an environment where nobody is shortchanged; where all students truly have equal access to an enriching and meaningful education.

Gender equality in Canada has always been a complex topic to discuss because we are often uncertain how to measure its improvement or lack of progress. Furthermore, we constantly debate over which variables are the most reliable and correlated to gender inequality. Do we rely on how much attention is paid to boys and girls or do we look at enrollment figures or graduation rate? Do we analyze employment figures, salary, or university registration rates?<br />
<br />
In the past 50 years, many authors have provided an extensive amount of qualitative and quantitative research. The qualitative research relies on responses that cannot be measure numerically such as feelings whereas others rely on hard statistics such as graduation rate. The reliance on both methods has complicated our understanding of gender equality as we struggle to find out what this means for schools and how new teachers learn from this issue and improve classroom conditions for both genders.<br />
<br />
In order to properly address this issue, one must accept that gender differences and biases exist in all forms in our society and have existed outside the school for many years. Secondly, using attention level is a poor and unreliable statistic, which has no direct relationship to achievement. Lastly, and the most convincing, the majority of statistics prove that Canadian girls have significantly outperformed boys in classrooms. Girls are in fact benefiting from the education system and are not shortchanged.<br />
<br />
In 2006, 84% of 19-year-old women had a high school diploma, compared to 77% of men in the same age group (Table 5). For women 25+years , 90% of women had high school diplomas compared to 86% of men. This difference clearly indicates that the existing school system does not prevent girls from excelling academically. Furthermore, girls are entering university at a higher proportion than boys. Since the early 1990s, women have made up the majority of full-time students enrolled in undergraduate university programs (Chart 7). In 2008 for example, 62% of all university undergraduates were women (Chart 8) . This means that less than half of all undergraduates were men (38%). If schools were truly short changing girls, we would expect higher drop out rates from girls. However more boys drop out from high school than girls.<br />
<br />
For elementary grades, boys and girls begin to demonstrate different academic abilities. In grade 3 specifically, girls outperform boys in reading and writing. Boys outperform girls in math and science. We should not be surprised by this difference. Boys and girls are in fact different in every way and as a society, we benefit from these differences. However, overall, girls still perform better at the elementary school level than boys. Statistics Canada reports that 24% of boys were tutored while 19% of females were tutored. 90% of parents believed their daughters were performing well academically whereas 69% of parents did so for their sons.<br />
<br />
Some argue that the socialization of genders in school is working against equality. For example, in elementary school, children are already taught that girls are unique to boys. Often girls are praised for being neat and tidy whereas boys are encouraged to think independently. The dynamics of schools today demonstrate but also unknowingly foster gender differences which some have considered bias and unfair.<br />
<br />
The problem with this argument is that society must come to terms that males and females are psychologically and biologically different and unique. The behavioral differences require different teaching styles and strategies. Teachers need to accommodate their classrooms and in Ontario, boys significantly perform worse than females. Males account for 70% of learning disabilities and the majority of behavioral problems. These alarming statistics may explain why some feel more attention is given to males in Ontario classrooms. Furthermore, in Judith Kleindelf’s research, teachers in fact pay more attention to girls than to boys. In her study, when both boys and girls were interviewed separately, each group felt that MORE attention was paid to girls while boys were called out more often. As Kleindelf states "….the research on classroom interaction does not show consistent teacher favoritism toward boys or girls. Whether we look at studies by observers sitting in the classrooms or the perceptions of the students themselves, what we see are small and inconsistent sex differences, some favoring girls and others favoring boys. We see no pattern of more academic attention going to boys, and, even if we did, we have no evidence that teacher attention in class has any relationship to achievement."<br />
<br />
The natural difference between males and females is also prevalent in career choices. For example, females dominate nursing and teaching. Can you say that males are short changed in the nursing profession? No, you cannot because certain jobs require different mental and physical strengths that are unique to each sex. Girls may simply prefer jobs that are more geared to their personal strengths. Although there are an increasing number of female students in trade school, only 50% of them are graduating. Lack of interest may be one contributing factor, which supports the idea that women are interested in certain activities. At the university level, there is a significantly smaller percentage of women enrolled in mathematics and agriculture whereas in health, education, and social behavioral sciences, females dominate at 77%, 76%, and 67%. Again, we pursue activities that we feel we are comfortable with. Interestingly enough, if 76% of education majors are female, is it possible that it is these female teachers who are short changing girls? Furthermore, if a high percentage of women are specializing in behavioral sciences, are they not the ones who are paying more attention to boys who are known to have more behavioral issues?<br />
<br />
In conclusion, the academic successes of girls clearly prove that girls are not shortchanged in Ontario schools. Girls receive more awards and honours and are graduating at a higher percentage. However, there are social biases that spill into the classrooms but they do not necessarily prevent girls from succeeding in academics. Gender biases are not created in classrooms. They are created at an early age by our culture and societal views, which is often communicated through media such as television, newspapers, and pop culture. Previous studies and statistics suggest that boys are more challenging to teach than girls because they exhibit more behavioural and academic challenges. Boys are also stronger in sciences and math than are girls. Although these differences will be apparent, the important message is that by building relationships and motivating all students, teachers will learn how students feel about gender roles and what they mean in their own cultural context. It will provide an opportunity to learn their interests and support them whether it is reading, writing, math or science. There will be challenges and conflicts between the genders and one of the most effective ways of dealing with gender roles is to use a variety of tools to help them achieve their goals.
