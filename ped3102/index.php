            <b>Are girls who are enrolled in Kindergarten to Grade 12 shortchanged in Ontario schools?</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            In the quest to come to terms with gender equality, some argue that girls
            enrolled in elementary and secondary schools are shortchanged. Girls receive
            lower levels of attention by teachers, which puts them at a disadvantage in the
            learning process. They are often encouraged to only enroll in extra curricular
            activities that are "feminine" such as cheer-leading, bake sales, etc. They
            are not encouraged to do excel in "masculine" activities. They are
            not encouraged to play a variety of musical instruments, only the "feminine" ones
            such as flute. Furthermore, the lack of effort by schools to change
            combined with the encouragement to keep
            the image
            of typical girl/boy roles reinforces that traditional roles of women and men are
            acceptable, thereby preventing any real social change. Are girls shortchanged in
            classrooms?
