<hr />

The debate of shortchanging girls in classrooms can be analyzed through student/teacher interaction, gender roles, and/or statistics:

<ol class="alpha margin1em top1em">
    <li>Attention Levels:  How do you measure attention levels? If there is biased attention towards males, we must analyze case by case and review the teacher.</li>
    <li>Gender Roles/Social Implications: Gender differences and its social implications will always exist. Women are different than men in more ways than we'd like to think. Women are better than men on certain aspects and vice versa. Get over it. School does not create gender diffs. The Canadian culture we live in creates gender differences and schools are just part of that trend. As teachers, we must promote gender equality. <a href="references.php#kleinfeld" class="reference">(Kleinfeld,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;8)</a></li>
    <li>Statistics: Girls are certainly not shortchanged. Their academic success supports this. They are given equal opportunity in classrooms.</li>
</ol>
